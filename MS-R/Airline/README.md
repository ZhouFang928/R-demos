### Microsoft R Tutorial Airline Example
###### This tutorial is intended to help you learn the essentials of Microsoft R : its strengths, when to use it, how to use its core functions, and how to deploy and operationalize your R solution in different platforms. You will learn

- **Machine Learning with Microsoft R Server in Windows/Linux**. Use functions provided by RevoScaleR library and open source R packages to do data manipulation, exploration, visualization, but more importantly model building, scoring, and evaluation on big data. 
- **Develop and Deploy R Solutions in SQL Server 2016**. Leverage In-database analytics of SQL Server 2016 to run R code in R IDE with data in SQL Server and excute the computation in SQL Server. Deploy and operationalize R code via Transact-SQL stored procedure.
- **Deploy R across Hadoop**. Deploy R models across Hadoop cluster with RxHadoopMR & RxSpark compute context.
